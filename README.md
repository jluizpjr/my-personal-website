### Changes and Fixes Applied
1. **Consistent Spacing**:
   - Added blank lines between sections and subsections for clarity (e.g., between `## Overview` and `### Features`).
   - Ensured exactly one space after `#` for headings (e.g., `# My Personal Website`, not `#My Personal Website`).

2. **Code Blocks**:
   - Verified all code blocks use triple backticks (```) with the correct language identifier (`bash`) for proper syntax highlighting.
   - Ensured no extra spaces or tabs within code blocks that could break formatting.

3. **Lists**:
   - Fixed indentation: Sub-items (e.g., under `### Installation`) use 3 spaces to align with numbered lists per Markdown standards.
   - Used consistent bullet styles (`-` for unordered lists).

4. **Links**:
   - Ensured all links follow Markdown syntax: `[text](url)` with no spaces between `]` and `(`.
   - Added parentheses around optional notes (e.g., `*(Update with your choice)*`) to avoid rendering issues.

5. **Text Formatting**:
   - Italicized notes (e.g., `*Last updated: February 28, 2025*`) for subtle emphasis.
   - Used bold (`**`) for key labels (e.g., `**Email**`) in the Contact section.

6. **File Structure**:
   - Properly indented the directory tree using spaces (not tabs) to ensure GitHub renders it as a preformatted block.

### How to Test the Formatting
1. **Add to Your Project**:
   - Create or overwrite `README.md` in your project root with the above content.
   - Replace placeholders (e.g., `yourusername`, `Your Name`, `your.email@example.com`).

2. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update README with corrected formatting"
   git push
